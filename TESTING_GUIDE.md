# 🧪 WebRTC P2P Connection Testing Guide

This guide shows you how to test P2P video connections using the sample client.

## 🎯 Testing Scenarios

### 1. 📱 Same Computer (Two Browser Tabs)
**Purpose:** Basic functionality testing

**Setup:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start P2P server
python p2p_webrtc.py
# Access: http://localhost:4000

# Terminal 2: Start client server  
python client_server.py
# Access: http://localhost:5001
```

**Test Steps:**
1. **Open Browser Tab 1:** http://localhost:4000 (Main P2P app)
2. **Open Browser Tab 2:** http://localhost:5001 (Sample client)
3. **Both tabs:** Start Camera → Allow permissions
4. **Both tabs:** Join room "room1" 
5. **Result:** See video from both cameras in each tab

---

### 2. 🌐 Different Devices (Same Network)
**Purpose:** Real-world P2P testing

**Setup:**
```bash
# On main computer: Start both servers
python p2p_webrtc.py    # Port 4000
python client_server.py # Port 5001
```

**Device URLs:**
- **Device 1 (Phone):** http://192.168.1.105:4000
- **Device 2 (Laptop):** http://192.168.1.105:5001
- **Device 3 (Tablet):** http://192.168.1.105:4000

**Test Steps:**
1. **All devices:** Connect to server at `http://192.168.1.105:4000`
2. **All devices:** Start camera and allow permissions
3. **All devices:** Join same room name (e.g., "meeting1")
4. **Result:** Multi-device video conference!

### 3. 🔗 Different Networks (Internet)
**Purpose:** STUN server testing

**Requirements:**
- Public IP or port forwarding
- HTTPS for production (browsers require it)

**Setup:**
```bash
# On server with public IP
python p2p_webrtc.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4000
```

**Test URLs:**
- **User 1:** http://your-public-ip:4000
- **User 2:** Use client_sample.html locally, connect to your-public-ip:4000

## 🎮 Testing Commands

### Quick Test Setup:
```bash
# Start P2P server (Terminal 1)
python p2p_webrtc.py

# Start client server (Terminal 2) 
python client_server.py

# Open browsers
open http://localhost:4000    # Main app
open http://localhost:5001    # Sample client
```

### Network Test:
```bash
# Find your IP address
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1

# Test from other devices
# Use: http://YOUR_IP:4000 and http://YOUR_IP:5001
```

## 🎯 What to Test

### ✅ Basic Functionality
- [ ] Camera starts successfully
- [ ] Server connection works
- [ ] Room joining functions
- [ ] Video appears in both directions
- [ ] Audio works (if enabled)

### ✅ Error Handling
- [ ] Camera permission denied
- [ ] Server connection failure
- [ ] Network disconnection
- [ ] Invalid room names
- [ ] Multiple users in same room

### ✅ Cross-Platform
- [ ] Chrome on desktop
- [ ] Firefox on desktop
- [ ] Safari on mobile (iOS)
- [ ] Chrome on mobile (Android)
- [ ] Edge on desktop

### ✅ Network Scenarios
- [ ] Same WiFi network
- [ ] Different WiFi networks
- [ ] Mobile hotspot connection
- [ ] VPN connections
- [ ] Corporate networks (may have restrictions)

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check Browser Console:
```javascript
// Enable verbose WebRTC logging
localStorage.debug = '*';

// Check WebRTC stats
peerConnection.getStats().then(stats => {
    stats.forEach(report => console.log(report));
});
```

### Common Issues:

#### "Connection Failed"
- Check STUN servers are accessible
- Try different browsers
- Check firewall settings

#### "No Video"
- Verify camera permissions
- Check camera not in use by other apps
- Try refreshing page

#### "Server Connection Error"
- Verify server is running
- Check correct IP/port
- Ensure no firewall blocking

## 📊 Success Indicators

### ✅ Successful Connection:
```
✅ Connected to signaling server
✅ Camera started successfully
✅ Joined room: room1 (2 users)
✅ User joined: user123
✅ Sending offer to peer
✅ Received answer from peer
